# Node Auth Boilerplate

This is a boiler plate for an express app with local user authentication. It exists so I have a customized boilerplate and don't have to start from scratch on all my projects

## What it includes

*Local Auth (email and password)
*Passport and Passport-local
*Sessions for saving user info and displaying flash messages
*Settings for PostgresSQL and Sequelize
*Hashed passwords
*EJS templating and EJS layouts
*Sequelize User model
*Materialize styling - nav and footer
